        <h2>Core Alkali Neutraliser</h2>
        <p>
            An acid buffer having capability to neutralize Core alkali after mercerization of cotton as well as after weight reduction of polyester fabrics. Keeping in mind the ever-evolving requirements of our clients, we are manufacturing and supplying a broad spectrum of Washing Agent. 
            it is used to remove alkali and ph control fo rnext process.

        <h2>Reduction Clearing Agent</h2>
        <p>
            Reduction clearing using aqueous sodium dithionite under 
            alkaline conditions at elevated temperatures is commonly carried out 
            as an aftertreatment to remove deposits of disperse dye and other impurity
             residues from the surface of dyed polyester. In this paper, the effect of 
             conventional reduction clearing on the colour and fastness properties of 
             polyester dyed with a series of selected commercial disperse dyes at a range 
             of depths of shade is established, and an understanding of the scientific principles 
             is developed. The results correlate closely with an assessment of surface dye removal
            by cold acetone extraction of the dyed samples. Because of certain environmental,
            technological, and economic disadvantages associated with traditional reduction 
            clearing using sodium dithionite, there is industrial interest in alternatives. 
            Thus, this paper also describes a study of the use of two organic reducing agents,
             thiourea dioxide and hydroxyacetone, and the relative merits of the three processes are discussed. 
             The outcome of clearing varies with the particular dye. Mechanistic explanations are proposed,
            based on individual characteristics of the molecular structures of the dyes. 
            Scanning electron microscopic investigations of the surface of dyed samples before and after
             reduction clearing were qualitatively consistent with the assessments of the technical performance.
            This paper is the first in a series in which we will subsequently report further comparative studies, based on similar methodology,
             exploring alternative clearing processes.

        <h2>Dispersing Agent</h2>
        <p>A solid material dispersed in a liquid requires an additive to
             make the dispersion process easier and more stable –
             this is the role of the dispersing agent, or dispersant.</p>
        <p>
            Dispersants deflocculate solids and thus significantly reduce 
            the viscosity of a dispersion or paste. As a result of this effect, 
            solid loading – the amount of dispersible powdered material – can be increased 
            accordingly. The dispersion phase is possibly the most time- and  energy-consuming
             stage of the production process. This is due to the different surface tensions of the 
             liquids (e.g., resin, solvents) and the solids (e.g., fillers, additives).
              A dispersing additive is necessary to produce stable formulations and ensure
             storage stability (no viscosity instability, no separation).
